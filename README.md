# manipulator_torque_controller
Generate C code of  computed torque controller from MATLAB simulink, then use the controller to control a manipulator in V-rep by using C remoteApi. The manipulator is abb-4600. Import URDF file to MATLAB to build manipulator rigid-body model. The dynamic model of manipulator in MATLAB and V-rep are same. To be continued...

## Environment
